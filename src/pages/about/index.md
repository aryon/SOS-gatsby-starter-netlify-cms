# Daily from 12pm to 12:40pm

##### Sharing our space for the entire season of Spring 2020.

##### Vernal Equinox, March 19 through the Summer Solstice, June 21

Every day, since the vernal equinox, a group of growing friends and family have made time for each other by making art together.To participate, you simply show up via Zoom ready to make suns together.

* After a half-hour of creation and fellowship, we share our story with each other through the joys, gratitudes, and challenges we record daily on the back of our sun.
* Finally, we share our suns to our community by posting them publicly in our windows and shared streets.
