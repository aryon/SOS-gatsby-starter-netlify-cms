        After a half-hour of creation, we share our joys and gratitude with each
        other and then share our suns to our community by posting them daily
        outside our homes.

  description: >-
    In community building, the third place is the social surroundings separate
    from the two usual social environments of home and the workplace. During our
    shared isolation under the COVID-19 pandemic, our growing collective of
    friends and family are exploring new forms of community.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
