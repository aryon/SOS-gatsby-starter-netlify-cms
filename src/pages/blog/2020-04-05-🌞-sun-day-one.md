Every day we make time for each other to make art together.

To participate, you simply show up ready to make suns together. 

After a half hour of creation, we share our joys and gratitude with each other and then share our suns to our community by posting them daily outside our homes.

\* [In community building, the third place is the social surroundings separate from the two usual social environments of home and the workplace.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place)
